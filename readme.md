For anybody who’s being bullied

( it can be tough to reveal your being bullied , because evil people feed off the weakness of Christians or Catholics , they ( bullies ) even disguise their hatred , towards what God ( the angels ) created that is beautiful and what God ( the angels ) leverages is God’s ( the angels ) own kin .

God : “ I’m them “

Bullies , literally don’t have the neuroplasticity or brain structure to understand they’ve ruined their lives beyond what’s regainable … they’ve create debt … in the government , that they can’t pay back , if they were to answer a lie detector about statues of the law that are total . )
