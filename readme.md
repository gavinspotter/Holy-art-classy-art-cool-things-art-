1 : Main theme : Mary and Theseus’s loom

2 : For anybody who’s being bullied

3 : ( it can be tough to reveal your being bullied , because evil people feed off the weakness of Christians or Catholics , they ( bullies ) even disguise their hatred , towards what God ( the angels ) created that is beautiful and what God ( the angels ) leverages is God’s ( the angels ) own kin .

4 : God : “ I’m them “

5 : Bullies , literally don’t have the neuroplasticity or brain structure to understand they’ve ruined their lives beyond what’s regainable … they’ve create debt … in the government , that they can’t pay back , if they were to answer a lie detector about statues of the law that are total . )

1 : then what is there ... ( from the bullies stance : " what is there ....... " )

2 : there's two things ⭐ neural networking , and brain plasticity and structure ⭐

3 : we will ultimately and we do it every day , neural network and torture people who bully and hate God as they purely oppose God , forever and ever . and it is ... RHD ( Right Hemisphere Disfigurement ) ; a bully has a low / small range of success . the object of a bullies brain plasticity and structure creates the feature of dysfunction as their total life . They never escape their disfunction ⭐ figure 1:5 ⭐ and live their lives in events of failure , the events of failure in their life bring on horizons of failure . It's total hell to live as a bully , and bullies have trouble acknowledging the truth , which brings on further utter destruction ⭐ figure 2:2 ⭐ . The angels always win and have beautiful lives , this is the promise God made , and the promise we accept when we hear his name ( 🌠 that forever lives within us ) which can be gathered or sequenced in these verses , Galatians 5:22 , Luke 8:11 , Rev 9:15 , the angels always win ... so why be so focused on bullying , unless its to display God's power , which is shown in the law and by the stars or the angels , or the heavenly host ... ⭐ figure 1:3 ⭐ Why don't you just shine bright . Because you didn't have the neuroplasticity and brain structure ... ⭐ figure 1:5 ⭐

4 : like this ... a person has an identity , and people take an identity , and they commit what they imagine to be a really intense ... " hit " . so someone will commit a " hit " , that doesn't exist ... like if someone had a hot car , and someone ... committed not a hit and run , but a grand theft auto ... but the car ... is still trashed . Its whatever cars are cars , ( 🌠 stay safe ❓ )

4 : 4 : on the basis ... of speeding tickets . that are lung cancer . and heart pressure ... but bullies can't use their mind to configure , what is total , and what is life , or to be an angel . ⭐ figure 2:3 ⭐
